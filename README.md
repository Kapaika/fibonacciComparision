This repository was created to show the complexity of different implementation computing nth number in fibonacci sequance. 

## Fibonacci Recursively

  The complexity in this case is exponential and the implementation does a lot of repeated work.
  
## Other implementation of Fibonacci

  As presents above, the best way to compute the n-th number of fibonacci pathern is to use the formula or  by streams.
