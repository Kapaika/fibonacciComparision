This repository was created to show the complexity of different implementation computing nth number in fibonacci sequance. 

## Fibonacci Recursively

  The complexity in this case is exponential and the implementation does a lot of repeated work. It is pointless to compare this implementation with the others becouse od the fact that the starting value from (100) take too much time to execute.
  
## Other implementation of Fibonacci

  As presents above, the best way to compute the n-th number of fibonacci pathern is to use the formula, it is O(1) complexity.
